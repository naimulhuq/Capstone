681457340,1574869428,CAN,Vancouver,Delta,@JetBlue my wife sent me a family invite but I never accepted it. She should not be locked into a family account that never got created.
681457341,1575234740,MEX,Tijuana,Delta,@JetBlue Hey guys do you have a tail number assigned yet to flight 1373 for tomorrow?
681457343,1574958820,PHL,Cebu,Delta,@JetBlue I spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they can't help. Need help with family pooling asap.
681457345,1575007564,ITA,Rome,Delta,At the airport ready to get this @JetBlue red eye going.... Soooooo sleepy.  #NoPlaceLikeHome #eventhoughits2degreesathome

681457362,1575072460,VNM,Hue,Delta,@JetBlue #1680 Super smooth flight and landing. Nicely done.

681457373,1575267817,BIH,Doboj,Delta,@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
681457374,1575137337,MEX,San Nicol√°s De Los Garza,Delta,@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
681457376,1575250745,BIH,Sarajevo,Delta,@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?

681460428,1575006667,VNM,Nguy√™n,US Airways,@USAirways I‚Äôm still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn‚Äôt up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
681460429,1575087864,DEU,Oldenburg,US Airways,@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... üòâ what about the impossible connection that started this?
681460430,1574987332,PHL,Mandaluyong,US Airways,@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
681460432,1575250128,ESP,Torrelavega,US Airways,@USAirways and despite tailwind‚Ä¶ Will still be late.
681460433,1575297372,SRB,Belgrade,US Airways,@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD

681460439,1575186964,ROU,,US Airways,@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...

681460458,1575191120,RUS,Saint Petersburg,US Airways,@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.

681460469,1574920939,IND,Mumbai,US Airways,@USAirways strikes again--late crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
681460471,1574895781,BIH,Sarajevo,US Airways,"@USAirways Can you follow, so I can DM you?"
681460473,1575007565,ITA,Rome,US Airways,@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
681460475,1575014040,VEN,Caracas,US Airways,"@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever"
681460476,1575166833,VNM,Hanoi,US Airways,@USAirways as far as being delayed goes‚Ä¶ Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
681460478,1575085664,PHL,Pasig City,US Airways,@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was cancelled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05

681460486,1575014200,IND,Delhi,US Airways,@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
681460487,1574895227,BIH,Sarajevo,US Airways,@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.

681460497,1574872642,CAN,Vancouver,US Airways,@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
681460498,1575223855,PRT,Loures,US Airways,"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."

681462170,1575190754,VNM,Hanoi,US Airways,"@nrhodes85 isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed"
681462171,1575149384,PHL,Cebu,US Airways,"@USAirways 2133. Flight now cancelled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA."
681462172,1575140298,CAN,Terrace,US Airways,"@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????"
681462173,1575273376,ITA,Turin,US Airways,@USAirways Thank you
681462174,1575293016,IND,Udupi,US Airways,@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
681462175,1575196754,VNM,Hanoi,US Airways,@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.
681462176,1575099358,IDN,Malang,US Airways,"@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps."
681462177,1574941363,CAN,Sudbury,US Airways,@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
681462178,1574851331,GBR,Hull,US Airways,@USAirways can I book using some sort of breavement program? I need to get home for my pops funeral
681462179,1574852803,GBR,Hull,US Airways,"@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?"
681462180,1574848271,GBR,Hull,US Airways,@USAirways Thank you. But I don‚Äôt understand. What will you do with my feedback?
681462181,1574957480,GBR,London,US Airways,"@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!"
681462182,1575066470,DEU,,US Airways,@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?
681462183,1574897230,CAN,Burnaby,US Airways,@USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
681462184,1574899915,IRL,,US Airways,@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already late? #youcandobetter
681462185,1575155378,PHL,San Antonio,US Airways,"@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!"
681462186,1575221114,HRV,,US Airways,"@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made"
681462187,1575182182,MEX,Aguascalientes,US Airways,"@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
681462188,1575014007,VNM,Nguy√™n,US Airways,@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).

681462193,1574951050,IND,Mumbai,US Airways,@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
681462194,1575297324,ROU,Timisoara,US Airways,@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
681462195,1575107048,HRV,Split,US Airways,@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless

681462203,1575034250,PHL,Pasig City,US Airways,@USAirways call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight
681462204,1574929074,ROU,Cluj-napoca,US Airways,@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
681462205,1575095768,CAN,Toronto,US Airways,"@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP"
681462206,1574930236,ROU,Cluj-napoca,US Airways,"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre automated."""
681462207,1575286694,IDN,Malang,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir , you cancelled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!"

681462211,1575026834,VNM,Nguy√™n,US Airways,@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal.
681462212,1574920922,IND,Mumbai,US Airways,@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
681462213,1575062321,CAN,Vancouver,US Airways,@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
681462214,1575246321,BIH,Sarajevo,US Airways,@USAirways what is the damn delay????
681462215,1574967993,TUR,Istanbul,US Airways,@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
681462216,1575163528,ROU,Iasi,US Airways,@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
681462217,1575207412,IND,Hyderabad,US Airways,@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
681462218,1575092377,IDN,Malang,US Airways,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
681462219,1575173170,ITA,Rome,US Airways,.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
681462221,1574832616,GBR,Hull,US Airways,"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
681462222,1575280331,IND,,US Airways,"@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
681462223,1574884464,IRL,,US Airways,"@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
681462224,1575224766,PRT,Loures,US Airways,@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
681462225,1575037767,PHL,Pasig City,US Airways,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
681462226,1574984734,IDN,Tangerang,US Airways,@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
681462227,1574897723,USA,Spring,US Airways,@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
681462228,1575147288,PHL,San Antonio,US Airways,@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
681462229,1575090239,PAK,,US Airways,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
681462230,1575275112,PRT,Loures,US Airways,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
681462231,1574953118,CHL,Santiago,US Airways,@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
681462232,1575125242,IND,,US Airways,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
681462233,1575046816,BRA,Salvador,US Airways,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
681462234,1575166830,VNM,Hanoi,US Airways,@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ‚õÑÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è
681462235,1575216994,ESP,Mora,US Airways,@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
681462236,1574965519,IND,Kottayam,US Airways,@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
681462237,1575042913,VNM,Hanoi,US Airways,@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
681462238,1575002555,SGP,Singapore,US Airways,@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
681462239,1574959776,PHL,Mandaluyong,US Airways,@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
681462240,1574854334,GBR,Sheffield,US Airways,@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.

681462243,1574985435,PHL,San Juan,US Airways,@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
681462244,1574851878,CAN,Ajax,US Airways,"@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour late. So thanks a ton for the great service today."
681462245,1575168842,MYS,Petaling Jaya,US Airways,@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
681462246,1574920752,ESP,A Coru√±a,US Airways,"@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard"

681462252,1575289980,GBR,,US Airways,@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather related. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
681462253,1575006184,CAN,Burlington,US Airways,@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
681462254,1575203814,VNM,Hue,US Airways,@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.

681462263,1575183251,ESP,Sevilla,US Airways,@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
681462264,1575288700,PHL,San Juan,US Airways,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but canceling flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
681462265,1574934654,VEN,,US Airways,"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
681462266,1574842319,GBR,Hull,US Airways,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
681462267,1575106786,ARG,,US Airways,@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!

681462273,1574951691,ESP,,US Airways,@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
681462274,1575196636,MEX,Aguascalientes,US Airways,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
681462275,1574957910,TUR,Istanbul,US Airways,@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
681462276,1575145878,MEX,San Nicol√°s De Los Garza,US Airways,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours late, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
681462277,1574890361,PHL,Cebu,US Airways,@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
681462278,1575268194,PHL,,US Airways,@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
681462279,1574966776,IDN,Jakarta,US Airways,"‚Äú@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?‚Äù Spring Break !!!"
681462280,1575059274,CHE,,US Airways,@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
681462281,1575019363,ESP,Barceloneta,US Airways,@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
681462283,1575270260,GBR,Carlisle,US Airways,@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. üëå
681462284,1575113796,MEX,San Nicol√°s De Los Garza,US Airways,@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
681462285,1575113987,HRV,Split,US Airways,"@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
681462286,1574890559,BIH,Sarajevo,US Airways,@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
681462287,1574947576,GBR,London,US Airways,@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
681462288,1574837622,SRB,,US Airways,"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
681462289,1575188131,MEX,Tijuana,US Airways,@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
681462290,1575024578,CAN,Burlington,US Airways,@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
681462291,1575167084,JPN,,US Airways,@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys‚Ä¶see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
681462292,1575290627,IND,Udupi,US Airways,@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?

681462294,1575173098,IND,Mumbai,US Airways,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
681462295,1575149994,HRV,Split,US Airways,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
681462296,1575068499,CAN,Toronto,US Airways,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
681462297,1574961458,ITA,Cascina,US Airways,@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
681462298,1575049392,PHL,Pasig City,US Airways,@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
681462299,1575124346,SGP,Singapore,US Airways,"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
681462300,1575114982,IND,,US Airways,"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!"
681462301,1575245653,HRV,Vinkovci,US Airways,"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
681462302,1575144651,PHL,San Antonio,US Airways,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."

681462367,1574912002,ESP,,US Airways,@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..

681462377,1574915167,PER,Lima,US Airways,@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.

681462386,1574834633,SRB,,US Airways,@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something

681462594,1574897203,IRL,,US Airways,@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.

681462609,1574936400,CAN,Sudbury,US Airways,@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.
681462610,1574971642,CAN,Sudbury,US Airways,@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already late arriving #evenlater
681462611,1575173123,MEX,Aguascalientes,US Airways,@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here

681462613,1575275785,VNM,Hue,US Airways,@USAirways shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout

681462628,1575171705,IND,Mumbai,US Airways,@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.

681677822,1575767619,SRB,Belgrade,American,@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
681677823,1575803035,SVK,Velke Kapusany,American,@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.

681677860,1575771462,SRB,Belgrade,American,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.

681678055,1575776930,SRB,Nis,American,@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs cancellation policy? Booked yesterday need to cancel
681678056,1575749957,IDN,Yogyakarta,American,@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.

681678152,1575787110,PAK,Karachi,American,@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.

681678256,1575790252,USA,Scottsboro,American,@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers

681679133,1575762482,MKD,Skopje,American,@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
681679134,1575800080,IND,Hyderabad,American,"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"

681679144,1575801124,BIH,Sarajevo,American,@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on cancellation. Lots of problems
681679145,1575756176,CAN,North Bay,American,"@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks"

681679176,1575767035,URY,Montevideo,American,@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.

681679299,1575784280,ROU,Cluj-napoca,American,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
681679300,1575798148,ARG,Punta Alta,American,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
